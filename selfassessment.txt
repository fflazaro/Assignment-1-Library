CSS342 Homework Self-Assessment

Name: Franchesca Lazaro

*On these scores, I didn't them rate perfect because I'm not sure how high the teacher's standards so I guessed my code is going to have a mediocre score. 

Do you have test functions testing all your functions? Have you tested
edge cases such as first element in an array, last element in an
array, empty array, etc?

--> I tried testing an empty array and if there was only one element in the array. I also tried the tests that 
were given to me, but I can't think of anything else to test. I did do sequences of testing such as printing out the library
after a book was removed or added. I guess that would be an example of "cross-checking" methods!
complete and correct programs:  45/ 50


Does your program compile without warnings? Are there any blocks of
repeated code that can be simplified?

--> My program does compiles without warnings and I tried to separate the purpose of each method as much as I can! I don't think there's a lot of 
repeated code or anything. 

good programming practices:     25/ 30

Do you have comments for each class both in the header and
implementation file? Does each variable and function have an
associated comment? Is your program properly indented? See "Code Style
Examples - Snippets" under C++ Resources for some common problems. For
example, all file names have to be in lowercase, all class names are
capitalized, need to have spaces after comments, stick to maximum 80
characters per line, space between operators, etc.

--> I added comments for many things such as methods, variables, the array, etc. I also tried to make everything consistent in terms of formatting. I also tried 
to make messages to terminal very clear. I also tried to make the comments clear, but I had a lot of descriptions! I think I did an ok job!

code that is easy to understand:     18/ 20
